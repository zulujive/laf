=========Opcode Table=========
	1. 0000 == Operand #2 is read back
	2. 0001 == Add Operands #1 and #2
	3. 0010 == Store previous output in memory address Operand #1 (5 bit heap)

=========Information and Explanation=========
    The LAF Architecture Delta is a instruction set architecture (ISA) and open-source CPU architecture. The CPU is designed in 4 bit architecture (Delta) and hopefully will be available in 16 bit architecture (Gamma).
    Instruction Set Architecture
        The LAF Delta ISA currently consists of 3 operations:
         1. Read back
         2. Addition (with carry)
         3. Store previous output
        All instructions are provided in 4-bit opcodes and 8-bit operands. The LAF Delta (LAFD) uses a hierarchical opcode pipeline, meaning each component of the CPU has a set of opcodes in addition to the primary set. This allows for expanded opcode tables and parameters.
